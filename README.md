# Overview

This is a flash card learning app for children to help them and their parents accelerate student learning. The target age range is from 4-10. Users can select to study 3 different topics, science, history, and math. Within those topics a user can select an easy, medium, or hard difficulty level. Points are added for correct answers and taken away for incorrect answers.

As a team we decided to make this app so each of us could learn and become more familiar with the Kotlin language as well as developing apps in Android studio. As a team we developed these skills. We also developed a deeper understanding of how github works, a healthy appreciation for when github does work, and practiced collaborating and working together as a team.
